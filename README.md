# CustomMapperMethod
daily job of programming we need to change object entity to dto and dto to viewmodel. this code will take input as your class entity and generate two method. one for entity to dto and other for dto to entity. in this code i am inheriting one interface and creating one constructor if you don't want you can remove that function so it will not generate for you.
